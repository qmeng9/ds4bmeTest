```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Here we will plot histogram of `mpg` variable from `mtcars`
First we look at this variable
```{r}
# library tidyverse has already been loaded
select(mtcars, mpg)
```
Then we create histogram using `ggplot()`
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg)) + 
  geom_histogram() 
```
